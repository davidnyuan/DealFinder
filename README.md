Welcome to DealFinder!

This is the final project for the Info 343 team consisting of David Yuan, Austin Hsu, Tyler Foster, and Michael Magee.

Project description: One thing our team members noticed during Black Friday a few weeks ago is that there is no great place to search through holiday deals. There is blackfriday.com, but that website is  essentially just a collection of newspaper clippings, and the user has to do all of the heavy lifting. As such, the idea behind DealFinder was to create a website that could find deals from online sources such as Groupon, Amazon, and so forth, and allow users to search through these deals. That way, all the "heavy lifting" is done client side, instead of user side. Users are able to create a personalized "watchlist" of items they are interested in, and create a favorites list.
